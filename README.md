# Scene streaming example
An example for Advanced Scene Manager that shows how to setup a scene streaming level.

Usage:
1. Clone
2. Open project
3. Download a copy of Advanced Scene Manager from asset store (we obviously cannot provide the entire asm package here, since that'd effectively make it open source)
4. Open Scene Manager Window, play!
5. Have a look around project, explore!
